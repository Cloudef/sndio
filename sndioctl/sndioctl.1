.Nm sndioctl
.Nd control audio mixer parameters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl iv
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Ar command ...
.Ek
.Nm
.Bk -words

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can display or change mixer parameters of
.Xr sndio 7
audio devices.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Dump the raw list of available parameters and exit.
Useful to debug device drivers or programs using the
.Xr siomix_open 3
interface.
.It Fl f Ar device
Use this
.Xr sndio 7
mixer device.
.It Fl m
Monitor and display mixer changes.
.It Fl n
Don't hide program names associated to audio streams (by
default they are displayed as comments).
.It Fl i
Display characteristics of requested parameters
instead of their values.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose mode, a.k.a. multi-channel mode.
By default parameters affecting different channels
of the same stream are disguised as a single mono
parameter to hide details that are not essential.
.El
.Pp
If no commands are specified all valid parameters are displayed on
.Em stdout .
Unless
.Fl d
or
.Fl i
are used, displayed parameters are valid commands.
The set of available controls depends on the mixer device.
.Pp
Commands use the following two formats to display and set
parameters respectively:
.Pp
.Dl <substream>.<parameter>
.Dl <substream>.<parameter>=<value>
.Pp
On the left-hand side, the affected substream is specified
by the stream name followed by an optional
channel range.
Examples of left-hand side terms:
.Pp
.Dl spkr.level
.Dl spkr[2-5].level
.Dl spkr[6].level
.Pp
There are three parameter types: numbers, selectors and vectors.
.Pp
Numbers are specified in decimal and follow the same semantics
as MIDI controllers.
Values are in the 0..127 range and 64 is the neutral state (if applicable).
Two-state controls (switches) take any value in the 0..63 range or
in the 64..127 range typically to the
.Em off
and
.Em on
states respectively.
.Pp
If a decimal is prefixed by the plus (minus) sign then
the given value is added to (subtracted from) the
current value of the control.
If
.Qq \&!
is used instead of a number, then the switch is toggled.
Examples:
.Pp
.Dl spkr.level=85
.Dl spkr[4-5].level=+10
.Dl spkr.mute=0
.Dl spkr.mute=!
.Pp
.Pp Selectors
Selector values are substreams; they are specified
as the stream name followed by an optional channel
range.
If no channel range is specified, the same
range as the stream specified on the left-hand side is used.
For instance the following are equivalent:
.Pp
.Dl record[1].source=mic
.Dl record[1].source=mic[1]
.Pp
.Pp Vectors
Vectors are arrays of numbers.
Values are specified as comma-separated components.
Each component is a substream, followed by
a colon, followed by a number.
If the colon and the number are omitted, then 127 is
assumed.
If a component is missing, then 0 is assumed.
Example:
.Pp
.Dl monitor.mix=play:120,linein:85
.Dl record.source=mic,linein
.Pp
Numbers are specified as discussed above.
Note that a vector of switches is equivalent to
a list.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr siomix_open 3
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following will set all
.Ar level
parameters that control the
.Ar spkr
stream to zero.
.Pp
.Dl $ sndioctl spkr.level=0
.Pp
The following commands are equivalent:
.Pp
.Dl $ sndioctl record[0].source=mic[0] record[1].source=mic[1]
.Dl $ sndioctl record.source=mic
